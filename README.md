Kaggle competition, regression machine learning algorithm to predict the feature "stroke".
Yeah, Basically we have given the training, testing dataset which was generated from deep learning model, we have 15203 tuples, five categorical attributes out of twelve attributes.
SO using Google colab with mounted Google drive, with the help of python packages like numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn etc, by mapping the categorical colummns with the new set of columns by one hot encoding, and finally  training the model with RandomforestRegressor, lasso regression, decisionTreeRegressor, Xgboost, we are the having the best score by xgboost as 0.87789.
